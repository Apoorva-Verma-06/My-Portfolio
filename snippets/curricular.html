		 	<p>I have been involved in 'Masquerades', the dramatics club of my college in events like Aagman(both as a participant and as a mentor) and Kshitij. I also represented my college at 'Oasis', the cultural fest of BITS Pilani, and at the INTER-IIT Cult Meet 2019, held at IIT Bombay in December last year. I was also a part of the dramatics contingent of IIT(BHU) who won the overall dramatics championship at INTER-IIT Cult Meet 4.0.<br>
			I also like to make wax crayon drawings and cartoon sketches in free time.<br>
			I was also a part of management teams of fests like Spardha, Asia's biggest sports fest involving more than 40 colleges accross the country, and Technex, Asia's oldest techno-management fest held at IIT(BHU), where in I got a chance to interact with guests like Laxmi Agarwal.<br>
			I was also a Part of Student Counselling Services at IIT(BHU). I coordinated the Induction Programme, an event for guiding the freshers of our institute, which involved more than 1000 freshers.
